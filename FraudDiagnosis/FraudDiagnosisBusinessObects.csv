It is a bookkeeping instrument holding the amount or value of something by registering the movements in plus and min when events happen which have an impact on the position.. The term "account" is usually associated to an accounting or bookkeeping concept to hold the financial or stock state of a business concept. An account will typically group the debit and credit entries for a specific aspect of the business resulting from transactions,. Often accounts are represented as a T-account which is a visual aid used to depict an account. Above the top portion of the T would be the account title. On the left-side of the base of the T would be any debit amounts; on the right-side would be the credit amounts.. A commonly used bookkeeping method is the double-entry method. This means that every transaction has at least 2 movements. If a customer pays 100 € in cash, there is. a decrease in the amount that the customer owes to the company (the customer position is decreased). an increase in the amount that the company has in cash (the cash position is increased). . An account can be assigning to one or more ledgers. A ledger is a group of accounts for a certain purpose. If there is need for multiple ledgers because of multiple purpose, an account can perfectly well assigned to multiple ledgers. When Ledgers are in real physical books, this is not possible. When ledgers are digital, accounts can be grouped into multiple groups at the same time. This practice is very rarely taught into courses for accounting, but in digital accounting, it is common practice.. .

Class	LienArrangement	""	""	"An arrangement for placing a lien against the account. . An arrangement that grants a creditor the right to use an asset as a guarantee for an underlying obligation. . . A lien is a legal right granted by the owner of property, by a law or otherwise acquired by a creditor. A lien serves to guarantee an underlying obligation, such as the repayment of a loan. If the underlying obligation is not satisfied, the creditor may be able to seize the asset that is the subject of the lien. (Investopedia). . A lien is a legal document filed by a creditor (lender) in order to record its claim on the debtor's (borrower's) property. The lien is recorded at a government's office. The lien provides a creditor with some protection or collateral until the debtor pays the creditor the amount owed. (Accounting Coach). . A legal claim against an asset which is used to secure a loan and which must be paid when the property is sold. Liens can be structured in many different ways. In some cases, the creditor will have legal claim against an asset, but not actually hold it in possession, while in other cases the creditor will actually hold on to the asset until the debt is paid off. The former is a more common arrangement when the asset is productive, since the creditor would prefer that the asset be used to produce a stream of income to pay off debt rather than just held in possession and not used. A claim can hold against an asset until all the obligations to the creditor are cleared (a general lien), or just until the obligations against that particular assets are cleared (a particular lien). (Investorword). . Difference between Lien and Collateral? The Lien is the agreement, the Collateral is the asset. So, a collateral agreement and a lien are synonyms. see also https://efinancemanagement.com/sources-of-finance/pledge-vs-hypothecation-vs-lien-vs-mortgage-vs-assignment. "	""

It is a bookkeeping instrument holding the amount or value of something by registering the movements in plus and min when events happen which have an impact on the position.. The term "account" is usually associated to an accounting or bookkeeping concept to hold the financial or stock state of a business concept. An account will typically group the debit and credit entries for a specific aspect of the business resulting from transactions,. Often accounts are represented as a T-account which is a visual aid used to depict an account. Above the top portion of the T would be the account title. On the left-side of the base of the T would be any debit amounts; on the right-side would be the credit amounts.. A commonly used bookkeeping method is the double-entry method. This means that every transaction has at least 2 movements. If a customer pays 100 € in cash, there is. a decrease in the amount that the customer owes to the company (the customer position is decreased). an increase in the amount that the company has in cash (the cash position is increased). . An account can be assigning to one or more ledgers. A ledger is a group of accounts for a certain purpose. If there is need for multiple ledgers because of multiple purpose, an account can perfectly well assigned to multiple ledgers. When Ledgers are in real physical books, this is not possible. When ledgers are digital, accounts can be grouped into multiple groups at the same time. This practice is very rarely taught into courses for accounting, but in digital accounting, it is common practice.. .

On the left-side of the base of the T would be any debit amounts; on the right-side would be the credit amounts.. A commonly used bookkeeping method is the double-entry method. This means that every transaction has at least 2 movements. If a customer pays 100 € in cash, there is. a decrease in the amount that the customer owes to the company (the customer position is decreased). an increase in the amount that the company has in cash (the cash position is increased). .

If there is need for multiple ledgers because of multiple purpose, an account can perfectly well assigned to multiple ledgers. When Ledgers are in real physical books, this is not possible. When ledgers are digital, accounts can be grouped into multiple groups at the same time.

It is a bookkeeping instrument holding the amount or value of something by registering the movements in plus and min when events happen which have an impact on the position.. The term "account" is usually associated to an accounting or bookkeeping concept to hold the financial or stock state of a business concept. An account will typically group the debit and credit entries for a specific aspect of the business resulting from transactions,. Often accounts are represented as a T-account which is a visual aid used to depict an account. Above the top portion of the T would be the account title. On the left-side of the base of the T would be any debit amounts; on the right-side would be the credit amounts.. A commonly used bookkeeping method is the double-entry method. This means that every transaction has at least 2 movements. If a customer pays 100 € in cash, there is. a decrease in the amount that the customer owes to the company (the customer position is decreased). an increase in the amount that the company has in cash (the cash position is increased). . An account can be assigning to one or more ledgers. A ledger is a group of accounts for a certain purpose. If there is need for multiple ledgers because of multiple purpose, an account can perfectly well assigned to multiple ledgers. When Ledgers are in real physical books, this is not possible.

It is a bookkeeping instrument holding the amount or value of something by registering the movements in plus and min when events happen which have an impact on the position.. The term "account" is usually associated to an accounting or bookkeeping concept to hold the financial or stock state of a business concept. An account will typically group the debit and credit entries for a specific aspect of the business resulting from transactions,. Often accounts are represented as a T-account which is a visual aid used to depict an account. Above the top portion of the T would be the account title. On the left-side of the base of the T would be any debit amounts; on the right-side would be the credit amounts.. A commonly used bookkeeping method is the double-entry method. This means that every transaction has at least 2 movements. If a customer pays 100 € in cash, there is. a decrease in the amount that the customer owes to the company (the customer position is decreased). an increase in the amount that the company has in cash (the cash position is increased). . An account can be assigning to one or more ledgers. A ledger is a group of accounts for a certain purpose. If there is need for multiple ledgers because of multiple purpose, an account can perfectly well assigned to multiple ledgers. When Ledgers are in real physical books, this is not possible. When ledgers are digital, accounts can be grouped into multiple groups at the same time. This practice is very rarely taught into courses for accounting, but in digital accounting, it is common practice.. .

Class	LienArrangement	""	""	"An arrangement for placing a lien against the account. . An arrangement that grants a creditor the right to use an asset as a guarantee for an underlying obligation. . . A lien is a legal right granted by the owner of property, by a law or otherwise acquired by a creditor. A lien serves to guarantee an underlying obligation, such as the repayment of a loan. If the underlying obligation is not satisfied, the creditor may be able to seize the asset that is the subject of the lien. (Investopedia). . A lien is a legal document filed by a creditor (lender) in order to record its claim on the debtor's (borrower's) property. The lien is recorded at a government's office. The lien provides a creditor with some protection or collateral until the debtor pays the creditor the amount owed. (Accounting Coach). . A legal claim against an asset which is used to secure a loan and which must be paid when the property is sold. Liens can be structured in many different ways. In some cases, the creditor will have legal claim against an asset, but not actually hold it in possession, while in other cases the creditor will actually hold on to the asset until the debt is paid off. The former is a more common arrangement when the asset is productive, since the creditor would prefer that the asset be used to produce a stream of income to pay off debt rather than just held in possession and not used. A claim can hold against an asset until all the obligations to the creditor are cleared (a general lien), or just until the obligations against that particular assets are cleared (a particular lien). (Investorword). . Difference between Lien and Collateral? The Lien is the agreement, the Collateral is the asset. So, a collateral agreement and a lien are synonyms. see also https://efinancemanagement.com/sources-of-finance/pledge-vs-hypothecation-vs-lien-vs-mortgage-vs-assignment. "	""

Class	Account	""	""	"A measuring state on which movements in value or amounts of assets, rights and obligations are registered.. . Comment: . It is a bookkeeping instrument holding the amount or value of something by registering the movements in plus and min when events happen which have an impact on the position.. The term "account" is usually associated to an accounting or bookkeeping concept to hold the financial or stock state of a business concept. An account will typically group the debit and credit entries for a specific aspect of the business resulting from transactions,. Often accounts are represented as a T-account which is a visual aid used to depict an account. Above the top portion of the T would be the account title. On the left-side of the base of the T would be any debit amounts; on the right-side would be the credit amounts.. A commonly used bookkeeping method is the double-entry method. This means that every transaction has at least 2 movements. If a customer pays 100 € in cash, there is. a decrease in the amount that the customer owes to the company (the customer position is decreased). an increase in the amount that the company has in cash (the cash position is increased). . An account can be assigning to one or more ledgers. A ledger is a group of accounts for a certain purpose. If there is need for multiple ledgers because of multiple purpose, an account can perfectly well assigned to multiple ledgers. When Ledgers are in real physical books, this is not possible. When ledgers are digital, accounts can be grouped into multiple groups at the same time. This practice is very rarely taught into courses for accounting, but in digital accounting, it is common practice.. . Examples: . stock account of a shop, cash register, bank account, financial accounting account, customer account, supplier account, .... Bank Account BE12 1234 5678 9012: is an individual banking account. Accounts Payable, is a collective account keeping the balance of the amounts to pay by the organisation to its suppliers. The balance is the result of the financial movements related to suppliers. This account is managed usually in a General Ledger . Supplier Account X, is an individual account keeping the balance of the amounts to pay by the organisation to an individual supplier. The balance is the result of the financial movements related to an individual supplier. This account is managed usually in a sub-ledger..
