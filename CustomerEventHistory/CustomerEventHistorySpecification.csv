"Role Definition"	"The service domain captures a wide range of customer events to build a comprehensive history of customer activity that can support subsequent behavioral analysis. This includes key sales/proposal events, relationship management events, product delivery events, detected customer triggers (typically gleaned during servicing dialogues) and possibly externally sourced customer activity. The assembled data is made available for behavioral analysis and for more general reference (as might be used for relationship management for example)"
