"Role Definition"	"The customer contact dialogue handling capability can provide highly structured orchestration to streamline a customer interaction by consolidating and presenting customer related data in context. It can also use the session to gather additional customer intelligence. In a more advance implementation the customer interaction capabilities can be integrated into an automated self/service context in addition to the more conventional assisted service model. The structured customer dialogue can include tasks to check for other business activities that can be built into the exchange for example, delivering pending communications, sales/marketing attempts, capturing intelligence/triggers, updating relationship status/details, product fulfillment (such as synchronizing customer-side data). The facility can be designed to support multi-channel/multi-device deployments"
"Example of use"	"A customer dials into the contact center with a current account balance request. The customer identity is checked by the servicing representative (using a Party Profile Service Domain call). After the customer initial query has been addressed the dialogue is structured to attempt a sales pitch for an internal campaign that the customer has been pre-approved for as flagged in their Party Profile record"

It consolidates and presents pertinent customer information and provides servicing guidelines with standard dialogue/scripting as appropriate. It can include the capability to provoke questions to capture key relationship and sales triggers.
