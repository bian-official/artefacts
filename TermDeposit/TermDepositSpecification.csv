"Role Definition"	"A Term Deposit is an agreement between a customer and the bank to place a fixed amount of funds for a fixed amount of time in an interest bearing account. Customers may want to place several amounts in deposit accounts in parallel and over time. In order to avoid renewed negotiations about standard conditions, a customer and the bank may agree on an overal framework agreement for these standard conditions. Under this framework agreement individual Term Deposits can be opened more efficiently. The current Service Domain handles both the individual Term Deposits and the overall framework agreement.. . NB In BIAN demand deposits are seen as Savings Accounts."
