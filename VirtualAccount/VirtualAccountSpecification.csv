"Role Definition"	"A Virtual Account is a bank account that is defined on an underlying real account. It can receive and send payments for the underlying account while behaving towards the outside as a separate account. In a light version it does not have a balance; it can be seen as only a funnel through which funds can move into and out of the underlying account. In a more full version it can have its own balance, but all incoming and outgoing transactions will be mirrored in the underlying real account. A real account can have many Virtual Accounts defined on it."
"Example of use"	"Virtual Accounts based on a Corporate Current Account can for instance mirror the internal accounts of a group parent-subsidiaries structure. Typically the management of the Virtual Accounts is left to the (parent). customer. This implies that the customer will be able to open Virtual Accounts, once it has a Virtual Account agreement with the bank. The bank will be responsible for the correct execution of the customer’s instructions, for the correct validation (including AML and KYC) and for the reporting to the customer and government and central bank.. . The owner of the Corporate Current Account has a Virtual Account agreement with the bank. The persons or companies (typically subsidiaries) in whose names Virtual Accounts run, do not have a contract with the bank (at least not related to the Virtual Account), so they will not be account-holders in the formal sense of the word. Their names are recorded as Account Name and can be used in correspondence and payments.. . Virtual Accounts can be of different types. In a light form they are just funnels through which funds flow into and out of the Corporate Current Account. A light form could typically be used for Payments On Behalf Of (POBO) and Collections On Behalf Of (COBO). In a more complete form Virtual Accounts can have their own balances, for instance in order to calculate interest. The latter may make them look more like sub-accounts."
