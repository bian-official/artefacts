"Role Definition"	"The customer profile service domain is used to tune the customer experience during any real-time interaction with the bank. A collection of status indicators, ratings and alerts can be maintained that are then used to influence the routing and servicing decisions that govern the customer interaction. For example a status indicator could include a warning that the account is in distress which would limit sales activity and might result in routing a contact to a specialist account recovery servicing facility."
"Example of use"	"The identity and active status of a customer is checked as they present themselves on-line to access their bank account"
